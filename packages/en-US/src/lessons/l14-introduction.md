# Lesson 14 - Events (L14)

In this lesson you will learn about events and how to use them in your code.
Events are a way to communicate between different parts of your code.
They are a very powerful tool that can be used to make your code more modular and easier to maintain.
In this lesson we will only cover DOM events like button clicks, but there are many other types of events that you can use in your code.
