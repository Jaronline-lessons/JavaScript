# Lesson 7 - Arrays (L7)

# Task L7.1 - Accessing values in an array

Create an array called `myArray` that contains the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
Next, create a variable called `firstValue` and set it equal to the first value in the array.
Finally, create a variable called `secondValue` and set it equal to the second value in the array.
Log the values of `firstValue` and `secondValue` to the console.
This should print `1` and `2`.

# Task L7.2 - Accessing values in a multidimensional array

Let's imagine we have a 2D array that represents a 3x3 grid.
The array looks like this:

```js
let grid = [
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9]
];
```

Create a variable called `firstValue` and set it equal to the first value in first row of the array.
Create a variable called `secondValue` and set it equal to the second value in the third row of the array.
Log the values of `firstValue` and `secondValue` to the console.
This should print `1` and `8`.

# Task L7.3 - Changing values in an array

Create an array called `myArray` that contains the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
Next, change the first value in the array to 6.
Then, change the third value in the array to 7.
Finally, log the array to the console.
This should print `[6, 2, 7, 4, 5]`.

# Task L7.4 - Array methods

## L7.4.1

Create an array called `myArray` that contains the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
Next, add the number 6 to the end of the array.
Then, remove the first value from the array.
Then, use the `join` method to join the values in the array into a string.
Finally, log the string to the console.
This should print `2,3,4,5,6`.

## L7.4.2

Create an array called `myArray` that contains the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
Next, remove the first 3 values from the array.
Then, use the `join` method to join the values in the array into a string.
Finally, log the string to the console.
This should print `4,5`.
