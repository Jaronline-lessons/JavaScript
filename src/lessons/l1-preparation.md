# Comments

Comments are used to add notes to your code.
They are not executed by the javascript engine.
Comments are useful for adding notes to your code and for temporarily disabling code.

There are two types of comments in javascript:

- Single line comments
- Multi line comments

## Single line comments

Single line comments are used to add a single line of comments to your code.
To add a single line comment, you can use the following syntax:

```javascript
// This is a single line comment
```

## Multi line comments

Multi line comments are used to add multiple lines of comments to your code.
To add a multi line comment, you can use the following syntax:

```javascript
/*
This
is a
multi line
comment
*/
```
