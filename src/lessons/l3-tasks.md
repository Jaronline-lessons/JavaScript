# Lesson 3 - Operators (L3)


To set up the environment for the tasks, you will need to create a folder called operators and create a file called index.js.
You can use the same index.html file from the first lesson.

# Task L3.1 - Arithmetic Operators

In this task you will learn how to use arithmetic operators.

## Order of Operations

In maths, the order of operations is a set of rules that define the order in which operations are performed when evaluating an expression.
The order of operations is important because it determines the result of an expression.

The order of operations is as follows:

1. Parentheses
2. Exponents, Roots
3. Multiplication, Division, Modulus
4. Addition, Subtraction

First, write down the result of the following expressions on paper:

- `2 + 2`
- `3 - 1`
- `4 * 2`
- `8 / 2`
- `2 ** 3`
- `5 % 2`
- `2 + 3 * 4`
- `(2 + 3) * 4`
- `2 + 3 * 4 - 6`
- `2 + 3 * (4 - 6)`

Now, write a JavaScript program that will log the result of the following expressions to the console.
When you are done, check your results with the ones you wrote down on paper. Are they the same?

# Task L3.2 - String Concatenation

In this task you will learn how to use string concatenation.

Write a JavaScript program that will log the following string to the console (use string concatenation with the `+` operator):

`Hello, my name is John Doe.`

Next, write a JavaScript program that will log the following string to the console (The age can not be a string, it must be a number):

`Hello, my name is John Doe. I am 30 years old.`

# Task L3.3 - Comparison Operators

In this task you will learn how to use comparison operators.

First, write down the result of the following expressions on paper:

- `2 > 1`
- `5 < 3`
- `2 >= 2`
- `5 >= 1`
- `3 <= 4`
- `6 <= 2`
- `2 == 2`
- `2 == "2"`
- `2 != 2`
- `2 == "2"`
- `2 === 2`
- `2 === "2"`
- `2 !== 2`
- `2 !== "2"`

Now, write a JavaScript program that will log the result of the following expressions to the console.
When you are done, check your results with the ones you wrote down on paper. Are they the same?

# Task L3.4 - Logical Operators

In this task you will learn how to use logical operators.

First, write down the result of the following expressions on paper:

- `true && true`
- `true && false`
- `false && true`
- `false && false`
- `true || true`
- `true || false`
- `false || true`
- `false || false`
- `!true`
- `!false`

Now, write a JavaScript program that will log the result of the following expressions to the console.
When you are done, check your results with the ones you wrote down on paper. Are they the same?

# Task L3.5 - Logical Operators with Comparison Operators

In this task you will learn how to use logical operators with comparison operators.

First, write down the result of the following expressions on paper:

- `2 > 1 && 3 > 2`
- `2 > 1 && 3 < 2`
- `2 > 1 || 3 < 2`
- `2 < 1 || 3 < 2`
- `!(2 < 1)`
- `!(2 > 1)`
- `!(2 < 1) && !(3 < 2)`
- `!(2 < 1) || !(3 < 2)`

Now, write a JavaScript program that will log the result of the following expressions to the console.
When you are done, check your results with the ones you wrote down on paper. Are they the same?
