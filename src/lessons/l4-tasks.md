# Lesson 4 - Variables (L4)

To set up the environment for the tasks, you will need to create a folder called variables and create a file called index.js.
You can use the same index.html file from the first lesson.

# Task L4.1 - Declaring variables and assigning values

In this task you will learn how to declare variables and assign values to them.

Create a variable called myName and assign your name to it.
Next, create a variable called myAge and assign your age to it.
Finally, create a variable called myHobby and assign your hobby to it.
Log the values of the variables to the console, the result should look like this (replace the values with your own):

`"My name is NAME, I am AGE years old and my hobby is HOBBY."`

# Task L4.2 - Incrementing and decrementing variables

In this task you will learn how to increment and decrement variables.

Create a variable called myAge and assign your age to it.
Next, create a variable called myNextAge and a variable called myPreviousAge and assign the value of myAge to them.
Finally, increment myNextAge by 1 and decrement myPreviousAge by 1.
Log the values of the variables to the console, the result should look like this (replace the values with your own):

`"My age is AGE, next year I will be NEXT_AGE and last year I was PREVIOUS_AGE."`

# Task L4.3 - Assignment Operators

In this task you will learn how to use assignment operators.

Create a variable called myAge and assign your age to it.
Next, create a variable called myNextAge and a variable called myPreviousAge and assign the value of myAge to them.
Finally, increment myNextAge by 2 using the `+=` operator and decrement myPreviousAge by 2 using the `-=` operator.
Log the values of the variables to the console, the result should look like this (replace the values with your own):

`"My age is AGE, in two years I will be NEXT_AGE and two years ago I was PREVIOUS_AGE."`

# Task L4.4 - Deleting variables

In this task you will learn how to delete variables.

Create a variable called myName and assign your name to it.
Next, create a variable called myAge and assign your age to it.
Finally, delete the myName variable.
Log the values of the variables to the console, the result should look like this (replace the values with your own):

`"My name is NAME, I am AGE years old."`

The myName variable should be undefined and the myAge variable should contain your age.
