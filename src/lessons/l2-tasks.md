# Lesson 2 - Data Types (L2)

# Taks L2.1 - Data Types

In this task you will learn about the different data types in javascript.
To set up the environment, you will need to create a folder called data-types and create a file called index.js.
You can use the same index.html file from the previous lesson.

Next, log the following data types with the following values to the console:
- string `"Hello World"`
- number `42`
- boolean `true`
- null
- undefined

The output should look like this in the console:
![Data Types](../images/console-data-types.png)

Notice that the data types are logged in different colors.
This is because the console uses different colors to distinguish between different data types.

# Task L2.2 - typeof

In this task you will learn about the typeof operator.

To set up the environment, you will need to create a folder called typeof and create a file called index.js.
You can use the same index.html file from the previous task.

Next, log the following data types of the following values to the console:
- string `"Hello World"`
- number `42`
- boolean `true`
- null
- undefined

The output should look like this in the console:
![Data Types](../images/console-typeof.png)

Notice that `typeof null` returns `object`.
This is a bug in javascript that has been around for a long time and will probably never be fixed.
It is not a bug in the typeof operator, but in the way that the null value is implemented.
